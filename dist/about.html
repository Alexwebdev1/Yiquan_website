            <p class="article-body"><strong>Yiquan</strong> is a Chinese martial art and exercise system. It is focused specifically
              on the mental aspects of the Xing Yi
              Quan exercise system. During this activity, the techniques of "zhan zhuang" (standing meditation) and "shi li"
              (testing
              force) are performed. During the standing meditation, participants practice proper posture in order to maintain a
              correct body balance. This is based on the premise that one must know how to "stand for health" before they "stand
              for
              combat." During the testing force, participants apply the processes developed in the standing meditation element,
              with
              the aim of releasing the force accumulated in one quick burst.
              <br>
              Through the practice of standing meditation, visualization techniques, slow and fast movement, push hands and
              sparring,
              Yiquan is a complete system that develops internal health, power, and effective fighting ability.
