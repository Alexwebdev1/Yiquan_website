              <strong>Yiquan</strong>, also known as Dachengquan, is a Chinese
              martial art founded by the Xingyiquan master Wang Xiangzhai
              (王薌齋). "Yi" (意) means Intent (but not intention), "Quan" (拳)
              means boxing. Yiquan is essentially formless, containing no fixed
              sets of fighting movements or techniques. Instead, focus is put on
              developing one's natural movement and fighting abilities through a
              system of training methods and concepts, working to improve the
              perception of one's body, its movement, and of force.

              Zhan zhuang is a kind of ancient Chinese art of cultivating
              health. Already over 2000 years ago in “Yellow Emperor Internal
              Classic” it was said: “In ancient times great masters stood on
              earth, supporting heaven, controlling yin and yang, breathing with
              essence of qi, standing alone, guarding spirit, with body being a
              one. This way they achieved longevity".

            <p class="article-body">
              Sitting postures were developed because of the inability to
              predict when an attack would be initiated. Practitioners had to be
              ready to counter an attack at any time, whether standing, or
              sitting. In modern China, sitting postures are also used for
              enhancing health. These postures are currently used in Chinese
              hospitals to increase strength and develop more energy. Many of
              these practitioners are unable participate in the more rigorous
              practice of standing postures because of diminished physical
              abilities. Finding a proper means of sitting support is the first
              requirement. At the beginning, it is best to use a large
              comfortable chair with lots of support and padding, an arm chair
              with a cushion would be a good choice. The full support will
              decrease the amount of effort and discomfort felt by the
              participant. In the initial practice, the spine and the arms can
              be supported in certain postures. As you progress in the practice,
              a chair without arms would work well; the spine may still be
              supported. At the more advanced level, a stool with little support
              is the best choice.

            <p class="article-body">
              The principle of Dachengquan, Master Wang said is that “There is
              no method for martial art. Even with a method there is still
              nothing. If we do not accept any method, then we can have all
              kinds of methods.” In this case method means styles, skills and
              techniques. He also said, “Something comes from nothing and
              steadiness is the mother of movement.” Dachengquan concentrates on
              developing the mind and spirit. Practising Zhan Zhuang will
              develop the mind, calmness, relaxation and a strong foundation.
              When the spiritual energy is high and you need to defend yourself,
              you will be able to move naturally, powerfully and instinctively.
              Just like an animal living in the natural world fights
              instinctively and powerfully. Everything comes from natural
              instinct, just like a baby needs milk from its mother and bees
              need honey. Sometimes even a very weak person, if they have a
              sudden mad fit, can be very powerful and it can take many people
              to hold them down. This is spiritual instinct, but this power
              needs to be developed through stillness and a calm mind. This is
              what meditation develops and so when you need power it will come
              naturally.
